Sure, let's break down the code:

1. **Parameter Initialization:**
```python
alpha = 0.5
gamma = 0.95
epsilon = 0.1
num_episodes = 5000
```
These are the parameters for the Q-learning algorithm. `alpha` is the learning rate, `gamma` is the discount factor, `epsilon` is the exploration rate, and `num_episodes` is the number of episodes for training.

2. **State Space and Action Space Initialization:**
```python
num_states = (7, 10)
num_actions = 4  # up, down, left, right
wind = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0])
```
The state space is a 7x10 grid, and there are 4 possible actions: up, down, left, and right. The `wind` array represents the wind strength in each column of the grid.

3. **Q Table Initialization:**
```python
Q = np.zeros(num_states + (num_actions,))
```
The Q table is initialized with zeros. It has a shape of `(7, 10, 4)`, representing the Q value for each state-action pair.

4. **Next State Function:**
```python
def get_next_state(state, action):
    i, j = state
    if action == 0:  # up
        return max(i - 1 - wind[j], 0), j
    elif action == 1:  # down
        return max(min(i + 1 - wind[j], num_states[0] - 1), 0), j
    elif action == 2:  # left
        return max(i - wind[j], 0), max(j - 1, 0)
    elif action == 3:  # right
        return max(i - wind[j], 0), min(j + 1, num_states[1] - 1)
```
This function calculates the next state based on the current state and action, taking into account the wind.

5. **Q-Learning Algorithm:**
```python
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = (3, 0)
    while state != (3, 7):
        if np.random.uniform(0, 1) < epsilon:
            action = np.random.choice(num_actions)
        else:
            action = np.argmax(Q[state])
        next_state = get_next_state(state, action)
        reward = -1
        Q[state][action] = Q[state][action] + alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(Q[next_state]) - Q[state][action])
        state = next_state
```
The Q-learning algorithm iterates over a number of episodes. In each episode, it starts from the initial state and continues until it reaches the goal state. It selects actions based on the epsilon-greedy policy and updates the Q values based on the Q-learning update rule.

6. **Policy Determination:**
```python
policy = {state: np.argmax(Q[state]) for state in np.ndindex(num_states)}
print(policy)
```
Finally, it prints out the policy determined by the algorithm, which is the action with the highest Q value for each state. This is the path the agent should take to reach the goal. The actions are encoded as 0 for up, 1 for down, 2 for left, and 3 for right. You can replace these numbers with the corresponding action names if you prefer.
